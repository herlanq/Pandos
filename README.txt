README File
This is the entirety of our OS after a semester of hard work.
Currently, our project is able to run 8 separate processes of your choosing.
Our program we wrote is just a simple output of a bunch of dad jokes through the terminal.
We still have not been able to figure out readFromTerminal or WriteToPrinter,
WriteToPrinter can only print out the first character of the string, then it stops working.
Other than those two issues, we believe everything else works accordingly.
